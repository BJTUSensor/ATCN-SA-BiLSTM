# ATCN-SA-BiLSTM

We designed a new attention based temporal convolutional network combined with bidirectional long short term memory model named ATCN-BiLSTM for Phi-OTDR event classification, achieving average classification accuracy of 99.6% on three types of events.

ATCN -- Time domain features are extracted while preserving the causality of time domain signals; SA -- The real disturbance information in spatial domain is focused and reweighted; BiLSTM -- Extracting bidirectional spatial features.
